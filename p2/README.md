## Game planning
You will use this game, or simulation rather, as a simple way to prompt who would "go first" amongst a certain number of players in a game - basically, this simulator will help you to decide who is player 1. After each player has guessed a number from 1 to 10, you will use the simulator to run a random number simulation to see who got the number correct, or who was the closest guess to the number. Whoever guessed correctly, or the closest to the number that was spat out, will be the winner.
